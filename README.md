# Intro Cybersecurity: Python Port Scanner (6 Tests)

This project demonstrates foundational cybersecurity and networking concepts
using Python. It was built as a step-by-step learning exercise to understand
how systems expose services through network ports and how those services can
be assessed at a basic level.

## What This Project Demonstrates
- Python socket programming
- Network port scanning (open vs closed ports)
- User-driven tool design
- Basic security risk awareness
- Logging scan results to files

## Test Progression
1. Test 1 – Verify Python environment
2. Test 2 – Single port connectivity check
3. Test 3 – Multi-port scanning
4. Test 4 – User-supplied target scanning
5. Test 5 – Risk labeling of common ports
6. Test 6 – Saving results to timestamped log files

## Common Ports Used
- **21 (FTP)** – Legacy file transfer, often insecure
- **22 (SSH)** – Secure remote administration (sensitive if exposed)
- **23 (Telnet)** – Legacy, unencrypted remote login
- **80 (HTTP)** – Standard web traffic
- **443 (HTTPS)** – Encrypted web traffic
