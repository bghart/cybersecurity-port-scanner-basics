# Wireshark HTTP Traffic Analysis

## Overview
I used Wireshark to capture and analyze live network traffic generated by my web browser. By filtering for HTTP traffic, I observed how a client communicates with a server using request and response messages. I followed a TCP stream to view the full communication flow, including an HTTP 301 redirect and a successful HTTP 200 OK response. This project helped me understand client–server communication, redirects, and how data is transmitted over TCP/IP.
